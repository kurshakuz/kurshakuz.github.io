Currently we are working on improvements of this project by using computer vision techniques. We are using landmarks for feature identification followed by mask for region extraction, binarization, erosion and dilation for iris size estimation for further drowsiness estimation. The project is still under heavy development with further aim at presentation at international conferences.
