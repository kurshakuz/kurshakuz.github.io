As part of Google Summer of Code 2019 I have completed the creation of the exercise infrastructure for the JdeRobot Robotics Academy. As a full time open source contributor, I have created robot model, introduced proper transformations for the sensors, intergrated global and local planners and created a map using SLAM in Gazebo using ROS.
