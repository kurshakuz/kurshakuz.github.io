Hi, my name is Shyngyskhan Abilkassov! I was born in Shuchinsck (Burabay) and now live in Astana, Kazakhstan. I enjoy listening to music, active tourism, snowboarding, and a little bit of playing the guitar. I also love reading historical (Les Rois maudits) as well as epic fantasy books like A Song of Ice and Fire.
