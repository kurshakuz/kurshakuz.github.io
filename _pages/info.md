## Basic information

Hi! My name is Shyngyskhan Abilkassov and I live and study in Astana, Kazakhstan. I enjoy listening to music, active tourism, snowboarding, and a little bit of playing the guitar. I also love reading historical (Les Rois maudits) as well as epic fantasy books like A Song of Ice and Fire.

I have bilingual fluency in both Kazakh and Russian, an advanced academic English level, and an A1 proficiency in German.

## Education

I am currently a BSc student at Nazarbayev University majoring in Robotics and Mechatronics. I have taken multiple courses on robot dynamics and kinematics, control, image processing, and machine learning as well as on advanced math and programming courses. Currently, I am in the top 5% of my class thanks to my academic performance.
