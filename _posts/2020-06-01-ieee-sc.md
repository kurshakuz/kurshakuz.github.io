Great news! I have just been selected to participate in 2020 IEEE Robotics & Automation Society (RAS) Summer School on Multi-Robot Systems! It's a wonderful opportunity to meet great international researchers and learn world's best robotics systems development techniques and skills and I'm very hopeful to be present there. However, event dates for it are still under discussion right now due to coronavirus situation in the world.

The Summer School aims to promote the newest achievements in multi-robot systems and swarm robotics to students, academic researchers, and industrial practitioners to enable putting systems of cooperating robots into practice. The content of the Summer School will be focused but not limited to systems of cooperating aerial vehicles. The topics addressed by well-recognized experts in the field of Multi-Robot Systems are composed to provide the participants necessary knowledge for understanding the available theory and for realization real-world experiments with a fleet of autonomous micro aerial vehicles in the last day of the Summer School.
