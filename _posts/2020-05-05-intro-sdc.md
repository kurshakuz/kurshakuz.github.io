Recently, I have successfully finished "Introduction to Self-Driving Cars" course! This is a first course of the Self-Drivig cars specialiation offered by Toronto University.

![](/assets/images/posts/intro-sdc/certificate.png){: .align-center}

In this course I have successfully: 
- Understood commonly used hardware used for self-driving cars
- Identified the main components of the self-driving software stack 
- Programmed vehicle modelling and control 
- Analyzed the safety frameworks and current industry practices for vehicle development 

In the final project of the course, I have developed control code to navigate a self-driving car around a racetrack in the CARLA simulation environment. In this project I have constructed longitudinal and lateral dynamic models for a vehicle and created controllers that regulate speed and path tracking performance using Python.

The lateral control was implemented based on a famous Stanley algorithm and longitudinal control based on a PID control.
